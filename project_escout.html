This project placed a lot of emphasis on user experience which challenged me in creating design solutions to make a web app that was both intuitive and usable to the users.

                <br>    
                This app is named eScout, an application for both mobiles and desktop
                that has been designed to track and record a football player's
                movements on the field.                
                <br>
                <br>
                Although designed to be used by scouts, this application is also useful
                for tracking the player's performance across various matches, creating
                games prior to their start date, and reconstruct past matches based on
                scouted data.

                <p>
                I was responsible for creating the interface and user experience of
                eScout based solely on concepts and ideas provided to me by the client.
                This challenged me to study and understand every aspect about how
                eScout was supposed to function, break down the ideas into categories,
                and create a visual concept with options & considerations for user
                function.
                <br>
                <br>

            <div id="center_text">
                <p>
                Again there were no predetermined pages or ideas on how the overall
                app would look, and at this stage that’s the best thing that can happen,
                therefore I was able to create wireframes from a user’s standpoint based
                solely on the conceptualised functions.

                    After establishing the initial pages of the app, and an initial user flow
                    based on the user personas, I moved on to testing the prototype on users. I
                    structured the user’s testing process in a way that was designed to have
                    them interact and move through the different pages of the app, with
                    basic knowledge of what the app was about, whilst recording their
                    interactions and decisions (such as why they thought to tap on a
                    particular element and what they expected to happen).

                <p>
                Prototype used to test on the users. It was made interactive, thanks to
                Figma, and roughly contains all of the necessary elements needed for the
                users to interact and navigate through the pages.
                <br>
                <br>

            <div id="center_text">
                <p>
                I wanted to keep this process of testing as natural as possible, with very
                broad instructions given on each task, as I wanted the user to interact with
                the app in a way that felt most natural to them.
                <br>

                <p>
                eScout records specific events by the user in real time, therefore it was
                necessary to create icons that visually represented these events so that the
                user could quickly distinguish them with as little thinking as possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                The desktop version acts differently from the mobile version, as the mobile
                version of eScout records data that gets stored onto a server whereas the
                desktop version stores and displays this information.
