                LilaConnect is a full-fibre provider delivering high-speed internet to homes and businesses across the UK. With a focus on modernising digital infrastructure, the company aims to create seamless, future-proof connectivity for communities.
                <br>
                <br>
                As the sole in-house designer, I played a pivotal role in shaping LilaConnect’s visual identity and marketing. I unified branding across all platforms, ensuring consistency while enhancing the impact of marketing materials. By developing targeted branding for monthly campaigns, backed by strategic research, I created meaningful visuals that resonated with the audience whilst strengthening the company’s brand outreach.

                This campaign focused on getting through the depressing period, when all your bills and taxes are due, with the power of music. Over 600 million users use Spotify alone (with 62% being in the UK), making music streaming a commodity in today's age.
                <br>
                <br>
                The task was to create visuals that expressed these happy, relaxed vibes whilst using LilaConnect's full fibre streaming service. I was personally pleased by these visuals as the centre focus was the emotions, and expressions, showcased by the user imagery. It is challenging to create something authentic when using stock photography, however, the execution of this campaign felt genuine and above all fun.

                <p>
                Since this campaign was aimed at using the internet for the benefit of enjoying music, it wouldn't make sense to have someone playing a normal guitar. I was inspired by video games such as 'Guitar Hero' or 'Rock Band' in creating a 3D render of a controller-based guitar (which also looks like a toy). These games could be used online, successfully creating a link between broadband by having the added benefit of playing virtually with your band.

                <br>
                <br>
                For this campaign, I was tasked with creating a concept targetting an audience that the company was struggling to market to.

                <p>
                To complete this task, in a short amount of time, I looked to LilaConnect's competitors to see what they were doing and also what their customers were saying. This was particularly easy with things such as TrustPilot, with real customers leaving their real genuine experiences with the product (verified of course).
                <br>
                <br>
                What stood out to me was the entry spike with which a lot of users, who weren't technologically savy, ran into. Therefore, I pitched a campaign that not only makes it easy to get the product but also makes it easy to understand it. No jargon, no tacked-on bundles, no bullshit. Get internet that 'Simply' suits your needs.

                Marketing campaign for LilaConnect's product launch into London. This campaign was a real positive & personal achievement for me as I was able to create an animated 6 sheet that was featured in the London Underground. To this day, it's crazy for me to think about the amount of people that access that service and saw something that I made.

                Highlighting this particular piece from the campaign as I had a lot of fun creating this looping animation that was placed alongside busy roads.
                <br>
                <br>
                It was particularly challenging to make the animation look 'natural', as these were originally flat images. These also weren't allowed to display too much motion, as it would become a distraction for drivers. Therefore, the animation was slowed down and subtle pauses were added to make the looping less distracting.

                My highlight from the 'Best Value Broadband' campaign. For this project, I was tasked with creating a dynamic animation in a ridiculously short amount of time. The animation got so much positive praise that the people at Port Vale FC ran it on their screen for months longer than originally planned.

                Be limitless with LilaConnect, a campaign that ran from June until the end of July. This would run for twice as long compared to previous campaigns, but it was also the campaign that I conceptualised & designed within the shortest amount of time. This campaign also ran alongside various sporting events, thus making the main push for customers to 'stream limitlessly' with play-on phrases like watching every sport all at once (only with LilaConnect).
                <br>
                <br>
                The initial concept was message-driven, to inspire customers with strong and striking messaging. The language and tone were to be confrontive, talking to the customers directly (but not harsh). The best example I can think of is Nike’s campaigns. Convince customers that LilaConnect will 'empower your every day' and inspire them to become limitless with LilaConnect's gigabit full fibre connection.

                <p>
                After working with LilaConnect for almost two years, I foresaw a lot of potential to elevate certain aspects of the brand (without needing to undertake a complete rebrand). A lot of work was outdated, made with designs from discontinued marketing campaigns, or even having no design consideration at all.
                <br>
                <br>
                Codenamed 'Ready, Steady, Connected', this concept looked to bring every piece of neglected material together as one cohesive brand voice. An element that was quite fun to play around with was the three shapes (triangle, square, circle) which were derived from the LilaConnect logo. This also created a nice brand element to use alongside typography, as stock imagery was becoming overused.
                <br>
                <br>
                Fun fact, the mockup for the bus was made using a similar rendering process to the toy guitar. Since there was no PSD mockup for the specific bus model, I made my own.
                <br>
                <br>

            <figure class="center_img">

                <figcaption>Proposed packaging + user journey for router box.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <div id="center_text">
                <p>
                One of my personal favourites from the proposed concepts is the packaging for the company's router. The original box was a lifeless piece of cardboard with zero LilaConnect branding, not even a logo. The proposed design looked to not only bring the box into the company branding but also elevate its use through the customer's journey.
                <br>
                <br>
                I considered the steps that customers would take when receiving the router by post, along with how they might feel or think before, during, and after. The proposed packaging ensured that the customer would know exactly where to start by including a 'Quick Start Guide' and placing it over everything. The router would take up the most space, and the ethernet + power cable would be neatly stored inside a cardboard box.
