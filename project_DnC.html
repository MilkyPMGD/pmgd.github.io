            Logo and branding design for Devon & Cornwall, Motorhome and Caravan Service and Repair Centre.
            <br>
            <br>
            The name is quite a mouthful, however it was important for people to understand the services from a glance. The visual element for the logo is simply a motorhome, there were explorations on how the action of 'servicing and repairing' a motorhome could be visually represented however the final approach leans towards it being the simplest visual form possible to help people better remember the business.
            <br>
            <br>
            Professional and with class, with a wealth of experience, but with the ability and experienced staff to help solve problems. It was important for my client to express this message onto his customers that the business is of a professional nature but also that they are experienced with tackling any problem presented to them, thus expressing this onto the logo from subtle elements such as the rounded corners and the stricking colour pallet.
            <br>
            <br>
            I was also responble for ensuring that the logo would work for social media, future website, business cards, signage and also for textiles use.
