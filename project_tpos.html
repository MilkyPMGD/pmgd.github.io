            <br>
            <b id="read_length">Read: 2–3 minutes</b>
            </h3>
            <p>
            <br>    
            Brief was to create a branding for an architectural 
            conference for Riba with the main theme being 
            wellbeing for the people. This proved challenging 
            to create a visual concept as there were a lot of 
            aspects to consider for this event; the first 
            problem being how to show an architectural based 
            poster whilst also showing people’s wellbeing.
            <br>
            <br>
            The idea of having jenga blocks as a concept took 
            some time to deduce, for such a complex theme, 
            however having something playful representing the 
            event was appropriate as architecture can also be 
            a fun process especially when designing for others. 
            A fun nod to this can be seen on the poster and how 
            each block was literally hand printed, showing a 
            human element.
            <br>
            <br>
            Banners were made to attract attention and 
            promote the event; both mockups produced show 
            how it can be advertised appropriately for both 
            outdoors and indoors. The trickiest part about 
            this was fitting the design from the poster onto 
            other size formats, without changing the brand 
            concept otherwise this would have broken 
            consistency for the event’s image. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The leaflet contains more information about the 
            event, such as speakers and talk times, which 
            would be handed out to visitors as they arrived 
            inside on the day of the event. The design still 
            contains the jenga elements as the cover however 
            on the inside it’s different as there are 
            fingerprints placed around the leaflet, these 
            are not placed randomly as instead they are more 
            or less where the person is able to hold the 
            leaflet to read the information, and legibility 
            is not affected by having these with text.
